/**
 * Sophie and Marc want to reduce the bubbles
 * of contacts in the belgian population
 * to contain an evil virus (weird idea but
 * nevertheless inspired by a true belgian
 * story in 2020, don't ask ...).
 *
 * Help them!
 *
 * The Belgian government has imposed on the
 * population to limit the number of contacts, via "bubbles".
 *
 * The principle is quite simple:
 * If you have a (close) contact with someone,
 * You are then in his bubble, and he is in yours.
 *
 * Let's say the following contacts have taken place: [
 * [Alice, Bob], [Alice, Carol], [Carol, Alice], [Eve, Alice], [Alice, Frank],
 * [Bob, Carole], [Bob, Eve], [Bob, Frank], [Bob, Carole], [Eve, Frank]
 * ].
 *
 * Note that the contacts are two-by-two and
 * can occur several times. The order within
 * of a contact does not matter.
 *
 * The resulting bubbles are :
 *
 * - Alice's bubble = [Bob, Carol, Eve, Frank]
 * - Bob's bubble = [Bob, Carol, Eve, Frank]
 * - Bob's bubble = [Alice, Carol, Eve, Frank]
 * - Carole's bubble = [Alice, Bob]
 * - Frank's Bubble = [Alice, Bob, Eve]
 *
 * Note that the relationship is symmetric
 * (if Alice is in Bob's bubble, then Bob is in Alice's bubble)
 * but not transitive (if Bob is in Alice's bubble,
 * then Bob is in Alice's bubble)
 * and Carol is in Bob's bubble, Carol is
 * not necessarily in Alice's.
 *
 * Since at most n people can be in someone's
 * bubble without him being outlaw
 * given a list of contacts, select pairs of people
 * that you will forbid to meet, so that eventually
 * each person has a bubble of NO MORE than n people
 * (not counting themselves).
 * You need to ban AS FEW AS POSSIBLE (pairs of) people to meet.
 *
 * For example, if n = 3, in the example above,
 * you could forbid Alice and Carol to see each other, but also
 * Bob and Carol. This removes 2 links
 * (even though Alice and Carol appear twice in the contacts!).
 * But there is a better solution: prevent Alice and Bob
 * from seeing each other, which only removes one link.
 * Finding an algorithm that solves this problem is complex,
 * that's why we give you a rather vague idea of an algorithm:
 *
 * - As long as there are links between two bubbles
 *   each "too big", remove one of these links;
 * - Then, as long as there are bubbles that are too big,
 *   remove any link connected to one of these bubbles
 *   (removing is equivalent to "adding the link
 *   to the list of forbidden relationships")
 *
 * Implementing this algorithm as it is a bad idea.
 * Think of an optimal way to implement it in the
 * method {@code cleanBubbles}
 *
 * You CANNOT modify the `contacts` list directly (nor the lists inside)
 * If you try, you will receive an UnsupportedOperationException.
 *
